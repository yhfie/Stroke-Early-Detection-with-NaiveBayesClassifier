# Stroke Early Detection System Using Naive Bayes Classifier

My practice of Data Mining that is: "Stroke early detection system using Naive Bayes Classifier".
Files:
1. `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv`: Original dataset from link below
2. `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data_CLEAN.csv`: Preprocessed dataset
3. `1-preprocess.ipynb`: Preprocessing notebook (uses dataset no.1)
4. `2-modelling-evaluation.ipynb`: Modelling and evaluation (uses dataset no.2)
5. `3-interface.ipynb`: Prediction using new data (case)
6. `scaler_model.joblib`: Using `scaler` variable cross-file since i code in separate files

I think it was inefficient in the data prediction stage (`3-interface.ipynb`) since i'm still learning. I will learn how to do it the right and better way.
Definitely far from perfect but i'm so eager to learn more! ðŸ”¥
